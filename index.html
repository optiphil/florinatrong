                <h4>UX Web Design At Its Best</h4>
                <p>We understand that this space is rather crowded. Truth be told, given the<br> relatively ease of engaging in this vertical, you’re probably inundated<br> with options and offers. Some of which may appear to be enticing at first,<br> but upon further examination, you’ll find that only a few can actually<br> deliver.  Web design agencies are plenty, but here’s something we’d like<br> for you to consider  when thinking of a potential partner for your business:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="our-features-box">
      <h4>Good web design requires business savvy:</h4>
           <p>     We’ve been in this industry for a long time, here at FlorinaStrong since 2008 <br>and several years prior to that. Launching a pretty website for your <br>business will not do the trick. Yes, everyone wants a beautiful site to<br> represent their brand, but apart from strategy and clear direction,<br> websites fail to deliver conversion, which ultimately, is your main<br> objective, or at least, it should be. Our focus lies primarily in a good,<<br> seamless user experience that is followed by a logical path of<br> progression, leading to a cart that is successfully checked out, adding to<br> your bottom line.</p>

            <div class="our-features-box">
<h4>UX web development partners, not vendors:</h4>
          <p> We are engaged in the success of your business just as much as you are.<br> Why? Well, that’s simple! We don’t lock our clients into long winded<br> contracts. We believe that we have to earn your love every time. Through<br> our month to month retainer agreement, you get preferred pricing and<br> preferred access to our staff. Quality developer talent is hard to come by.<br> Partnering with FlorinaStrong will ensure you have access to our<br> development team every time you need something done, and contrary to<br> the industry standard, we are still answering our phones and caring for<br> our clients just as we did when we first started in 2008.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="our-features-box">
               
                <h4> Strategy that makes sense:</h4>
               <p> Here at FlorinaStrong, no good money is thrown after bad. Online marketing<br> strategy is a bit of a beast. We don’t mean to mystify something that is<br> explainable, but keep in mind that things change rather fast in this space,<br> and we are tenacious about keeping up with the latest trends. With a <br>wide array of outlets and tools at our disposal, online marketing is<br> something we breath in and out daily. From Google<br> searches to Google shopping, Amazon ads to social media sales, we cover it all.

                <h4>Marketing Automation:</h4>
               <p> When we first heard about marketing automation way back in the day, we<br> felt bad that we didn’t invent it! Today, we can’t imagine a solid digital <br>strategy apart from a good marketing automation platform in place,<br> nurturing and searing the brand of your company in the forefront of your <br>potential customers’ mind. Given the diverse portfolio of clients we have,<br> we work with a number of different platforms including Marketo, <br>InfusionSoft, SalesForce, and others.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="our-features-box">
                <h4>Content is king</h4>
          <p>      Developing content that is on mark takes time and effort, and frankly, is<br> not the job for a newbie just because they’re cheap. Well written content<br> is the first opportunity you have to present your case to a potential client.<br> Remember that everything else they see on your site will essentially be<br> the wrapper for what we offer in the form of the written word. Well<br> written content has the power to instill trust, clarify complex ideas into <br>digestible concepts, and ultimately, move a prospect to pick up the phone<br> and call or simply press the so important “buy now” button on your<br> website.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>We know talk is cheap. Don’t take our word for it. Take a look around the web and see the<br> wonderful things our clients have to say about us. We<br> are not here to blow sunshine up anybody’s butt. We are not miracle<br> workers. We are professional marketers, designers, developers and<br> strategists who love what we do with a passion, and we will do all we can<br> to see you benefit from our work and drive to see your success.</p>

</h4>
<p>To explain our success to others we tell them the nature of our relationship with our clients. Our <br>clients rely on us not as a vendor, or a<br> far away resource. No, they call us, they visit us in person, we visit them,<br> we sit together and we work out solutions with a common goal. Client’s<br> have access to the CEO’s cell number, email and are always welcome to<br> speak to him about anything that may be relevant to the health of the<br> ongoing relationship. Great ideas and marketing initiatives have been<br> born in our conference room and we love the collaborative nature of our<br> job. Your success is our success.</p>

    I love working with Fahrenheit. I feel like they are more of an extension of my team instead of a <br>firm that does work for me. I can always trust that I can come to them with a challenge or project<br> and they will create a innovative, well-thought out plan/product. The final product is always<br> creative, well-designed, and functional. I look forward to continuing to work with them for many<br> years.</p>
